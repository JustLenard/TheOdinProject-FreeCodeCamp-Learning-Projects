#Learning projects

I will be dumping all the curriculum projects that I will be doing on FreeCodeCamp and TheOdinProject platforms here. Both the bad ones and the good ones.

Those worth looking at will be marked with â˜…Good.

I can't believe it. Such a stupid thing happened to me. 
My only acces to electricity for my PC died. Now I can't fucking code. 
The thing is, I even did some coding in the morning but
Didn't push it. I so don't wanna lose my streak so fuck, this what I am going to do.
